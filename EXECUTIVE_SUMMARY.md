# Executive Summary

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to take on technical work as a non-technical founder.  

> Note: Before 2025 I had never fine-tuned a model or built anything in Python beyond completing Day 8 in 100 Days to Code on Udemy.  
> Using “vibe coding” and trial-and-error iteration with AI assistants I set up my machine, fine-tuned Mistral-7B within two weeks, and later built a calendar engine with at least 10 interlocking mathematical mechanisms.  
> I still don’t know most of the technical terms or how to code, but I know how to build momentum, debug one layer at a time, and make complex systems work.

- In **Feb 2025**, within two weeks of receiving my new computer, I fine-tuned a **Mistral-7B model** using a custom dataset (~1,200 examples). The second iteration produced meaningful improvements, showing I could move from setup to working model very quickly.  
- From **Mar–Jun 2025**, I built a **mathematically complex calendar system** that required at least 10 interdependent mechanisms (cyclical offsets, modular resets, leap year handling, time-zone conversions, etc.), debugging each layer until the system worked end-to-end.
- That calendar code also contains a Dataset Generator that can be scaled beyond its current output of 3000 entries (7MB) 
- In **Jul–Aug 2025**, I extended the calendar project into a **Bitcoin price movement predictor (manual Excel prototype)**.  
- As of **Sep 2025**, I’m returning to fine-tuning with a stronger foundation, ready to expand datasets, run evaluations, and iterate faster.  

Together, these projects show rapid learning, hands-on persistence, and the ability to ship working systems under uncertainty.
