ENA is a deterministic emotional recursion engine. It models regulation with math and geometry, not generative prompts.  
The working core runs in under ~1,000 lines of Python and is observable in real time.
In just 19 days, I built a working emotional recursion engine that models self-regulation mathematically.  

This is emotion as geometry and regulation as math. A closed emotional feedback system, not a prompt stack.

## What We Built
A compact, modular system that interprets signals, progresses state on a closed mathematical path, and visualizes recovery.  
It is reproducible by design: identical inputs yield identical trajectories.
Unlike a chatbot, ENA doesn’t imitate emotion — it processes, stabilizes, and recovers using deterministic logic.  


## Development Pace
- **v1.0 → v4.8:** built in **Oct 17 - 24 2025 (8 days)**  
- **v5.0 → v5.9:** built in the **Oct 25 - Nov 4 2025 (11 days)**  
Total: **19 days** from first prototype to the current stable demo (v5.9).

## Why It’s Different
- Deterministic and interpretable (no stochastic behavior in runtime)  
- Small, understandable core that still produces rich behavior  
- Designed for trustworthy interaction and future conversational integration

## Development Background
The ~1,000-line core is the distillation of extensive experimentation.  
Earlier exploratory code spanned many files and thousands of lines; successive reductions compressed that complexity into a clear, maintainable engine.

## Road Ahead (12-Month Plan)
- **0–3 months:** stabilize the core for production and connect a conversational interface  
- **3–6 months:** user pilots, reliability testing, and evaluation harness  
- **6–12 months:** application pilots (coaching/HR/communications) based on the deterministic engine
