# Dataset Generator Output (Sample)

This dataset was generated on **Sept 19, 2025** using my custom calendar system.  
The generator is configurable — while this run produced **3,000 entries**, it can be scaled to **10,000+ entries** (or any number) by adjusting a single parameter in the script.  

The full dataset from this run is here: [`Dataset_Generator.jsonl`](./Dataset_Generator.jsonl) (7MB).
