# Input Interpretation (Pseudocode)

This module transforms external input into a structured internal signal the system can reason about. It abstracts language or symbolic material into a consistent internal format while preserving relevant emotional and contextual information.

Through proprietary interpretation logic, it filters and organizes incoming data, deriving directional and relational cues without exposing lexical, mathematical, or weighting methods. The result is a harmonized representation the core system can process, enabling coherent emotional alignment and response generation.
