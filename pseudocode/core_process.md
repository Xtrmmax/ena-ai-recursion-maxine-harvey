# Core Process (Pseudocode)

This component serves as the system’s regulatory center, translating interpreted input into controlled state evolution. It governs internal alignment and consistency, ensuring that responses follow a coherent emotional and contextual trajectory rather than arbitrary fluctuations.

Each cycle applies a proprietary framework to integrate new signals, update the model’s internal configuration, and maintain systemic balance. All transitions are deterministic, producing identical results under identical conditions while preserving the confidentiality of governing equations and control mechanics.
