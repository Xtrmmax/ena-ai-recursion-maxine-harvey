# ENA.ai — Emotional Recursion Engine (v5.9)

**Emotion as geometry. Regulation as math.**  
A deterministic system that models emotional self-regulation through mathematical reasoning rather than generative prediction.

## Overview
ENA.ai defines **deterministic emotional physics** — a set of fixed mathematical constraints that describe how emotional states rise, balance, and recover.  
These constraints never change, but each adaptive persona (like *Silia*) operates within its own internal parameters — weighted emotional priorities that shape how it interprets and responds.  
A persona can flex momentarily under pressure or during recovery, yet always returns to its own baseline balance, preserving identity and continuity.

The full working core runs in under **1,000 lines of Python** and is observable in real time.  
Version **5.9** was built from concept to stability in **19 days** — a compact, deterministic prototype that demonstrates emotion as geometry and regulation as math.

## Why It’s Different
- **Deterministic:** identical inputs always yield identical results.  
- **Adaptive:** each persona behaves uniquely within fixed mathematical limits.  
- **Interpretable:** every change is visible, traceable, and reproducible.  
- **Compact:** ~1,000 lines of code define the full regulation system.

## Road Ahead (12-Month Plan)
- **0–3 months:** finalize production build and connect conversational interface.  
- **3–6 months:** user pilots, reliability testing, and performance evaluation.  
- **6–12 months:** deploy applied pilots in coaching, HR, and communication systems.
