# ENA.ai — Emotional Recursion Engine (v5.9)

**Emotion as geometry. Regulation as math.**  
A deterministic system that models self-regulation through mathematical reasoning rather than generative prediction.

## Overview
ENA.ai is a deterministic emotional recursion engine.  
It models regulation using closed mathematical logic — a system that can process, stabilize, and recover emotion autonomously.  
Unlike a chatbot, ENA does not imitate empathy through language; it performs regulation as a mathematical process.

The full working core runs in under **1,000 lines of Python** and is observable in real time.  
This version, **v5.9**, was built from concept to stability in **19 days** — a complete emotional recursion prototype developed and validated end-to-end.

---

## Development Pace
- **v1.0 → v4.8:** Oct 17–24, 2025 (8 days)  
- **v5.0 → v5.9:** Oct 25–Nov 4, 2025 (11 days)  
**Total:** 19 days from first prototype to the current stable release (v5.9).

Behind that compact system lies extensive experimentation — thousands of lines of early exploratory code refined down into a mathematically consistent, interpretable framework.

---

## Why It’s Different
- **Deterministic:** identical inputs always yield identical results.  
- **Interpretable:** every state and transition is transparent.  
- **Compact:** a complete recursion engine in ~1,000 lines of code.  
- **Foundational:** built for future conversational integration and empathy modeling.

## Determinism Guarantee
ENA operates with **no random sampling, seeds, or probabilistic weighting**.  
Given the same sequence of inputs, it will always produce identical outputs.  
Every cycle is mathematically reproducible and verifiable.

---

## Road Ahead (12-Month Plan)
- **0–3 months:** stabilize the core for production and integrate conversational interface.  
- **3–6 months:** user pilots, reliability testing, and evaluation harness.  
- **6–12 months:** deploy applied pilots (coaching, HR, communication systems).

All proprietary implementation details and mathematical parameters are withheld in this public version for IP protection.
