# Archive — Pre–ENA.ai Recursion Projects
*(Historical portfolio — foundational prototypes prior to ENA.ai Recursion v5.9)*

---

## Overview
This archive contains earlier prototype work that laid the conceptual and technical groundwork for **ENA.ai Recursion**, the deterministic emotional regulation engine developed later.

Each archived project represents a key learning milestone — moving from model fine-tuning and behavioral mapping toward the rule-based emotional architecture now powering ENA.ai.

## Archived Projects

### Project_1_Finetuning
- **Focus:** Data curation, model fine-tuning, and sensory (VAKOG) encoding experiments.  
- **Purpose:** Establish mapping between user language and representational systems (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).  
- **Artifacts:**  
  - `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`, and early training scripts.  
  - Datasets and checkpoints demonstrating supervised alignment work.  
- **Outcome:** Inspired the geometric emotion-mapping approach used in later recursion models.

---

### Project_2_Calendar
- **Focus:** Personalized scheduling, state tracking, and user-context reasoning.  
- **Purpose:** Explore multi-variable context management and temporal decision logic.  
- **Artifacts:**  
  - Prototype calendar reasoning models (`scripts/`, `datasets/`, `outputs/`).  
  - Descriptive summaries (`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `README.md`).  
- **Outcome:** Introduced the concept of *temporal regulation*, later formalized as the **TemporalNeedEngine** in ENA.ai Recursion.

## Context
All files here are preserved for provenance and review.  
They are **no longer in the active import chain** but represent the intellectual evolution toward the ENA.ai Recursion prototype showcased for YC.
