# Archive — Pre–ENA.ai Recursion Projects
*(Historical portfolio — foundational prototypes prior to ENA.ai Recursion v5.9)*

---

## Overview
This archive contains early prototype work that established the conceptual and technical foundations for **ENA.ai Recursion**, the deterministic emotional regulation engine developed later.

Each archived project represents a learning milestone — moving from **model fine-tuning** and **symbolic behavioral systems** toward the **rule-based emotional geometry** now powering ENA.ai.

## Archived Projects

### Project_1_Finetuning
- **Focus:** Model fine-tuning and sensory (VAKOG) encoding experiments.  
- **Purpose:** Map user language to representational modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).  
- **Artifacts:**  
  - `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`, early fine-tuning scripts.  
  - Datasets and checkpoints demonstrating supervised alignment.  
- **Outcome:** Inspired the later geometric emotion-mapping used in ENA.ai Recursion.

---

### Project_2_Calendar
- **Focus:** Behavioral prediction through temporal and symbolic logic.  
- **Purpose:** Explore cyclical pattern modeling and personality forecasting.  
- **Artifacts:**  
  - Prototype calendar engine (`scripts/`, `datasets/`, `outputs/`).  
  - Documentation (`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `README.md`).  
- **Outcome:** Introduced **deterministic temporal regulation**, the conceptual forerunner of ENA.ai’s **TemporalNeedEngine**.

## Context
All files are preserved for provenance and review.  
They are **no longer part of the active system**, but illustrate the intellectual evolution that led to the ENA.ai Recursion prototype submitted for YC review.
