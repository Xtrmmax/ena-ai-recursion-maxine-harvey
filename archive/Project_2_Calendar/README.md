# Calendar Engine ReadMe

📄 For a quick overview, see the [Calendar Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)

> Note: Before March 2025 my only experience in Python was getting to Day 8 of 100 Days of Coding on Udemy.  
> Using “vibe coding” and trial-and-error iteration with AI assistants, I built a **deterministic behavioral calendar engine** with more than ten interlocking mechanisms (cyclical offsets, leap years, time zones, symbolic mapping, exception handling, etc.).  
> I still don’t know most of the technical terms — but I understand how to layer logic, test determinism, and make complex systems work.

## Overview
Built from **March–June 2025**, this system was my second major technical project.  
The **Mexica (Aztec) calendar engine** computes **behavioral and personality profiles** from date and time inputs using symbolic and mathematical mappings.

Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which is linear, this engine operates on **cyclical interdependencies** — modular resets, time-zone shifts, leap-year corrections, and symbolic offsets all working in harmony.  
Each module had to be debugged and tuned in sequence before the engine produced consistent outputs.

## What’s Here
- `calendar_engine_pseudocode.md` → structural overview of the proprietary engine  
- `/datasets` → simplified JSON examples (`simplified_day_glyphs.json`)  
- `/outputs` → deterministic sample outputs and dataset generator summaries  
- **Proprietary core code** retained privately for IP protection  

---

## Results
- Generated thousands of **deterministic, personality-based outputs**  
- Produced full datasets for behavioral prediction and symbolic modeling  
- Verified mathematical determinism across cyclical transformations  
- Extended the system (July–Aug 2025) into a **Bitcoin behavioral predictor** (manual prototype)

## Reflection
This was my first fully deterministic symbolic model.  
It taught me **modular debugging, rule-based architecture, and cyclic logic design**, shaping how I later built the **Temporal Need Engine (TNE)** inside ENA.ai Recursion.

---

## Transition to ENA.ai Recursion
The Calendar Engine modeled **behavior through time**.  
ENA.ai Recursion models **emotion through geometry**.  
Both use **mathematical determinism** — different languages, same principle.

> deterministic input → cyclical transformation → interpretable, symbolic output.

| Calendar Engine | ENA.ai Recursion |
|------------------|------------------|
| Symbolic time cycles | Emotional regulation loops |
| Behavioral archetypes | Affective states (valence/arousal/trust) |
| Mexica (Aztec) symbolic math | Emotional geometric math |
| Predictive personality output | Predictive emotional recovery |

The calendar predicted **behavioral rhythm**; ENA.ai predicts **emotional rhythm**.  
Together they form a conceptual continuum — pattern → process → regulation.

> This repository includes pseudocode and deterministic examples to demonstrate structure and capability.
