# Fine-Tuning Work — ReadMe

📄 For context, see the [Fine-Tuning Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md).

> Before February 2025, I had never fine-tuned a model or configured an AI development environment.  
> Through rapid experimentation (“vibe coding”) and AI-assisted iteration, I learned to prepare datasets, manage dependencies, and fine-tune large models within two weeks.

## Overview
Within **14 days of starting**, I successfully fine-tuned my **second Mistral-7B model** on ~1,200 examples (`vakog_dataset_clean.json`).  
This was my first hands-on technical project — a starting point for everything that followed.

After this milestone, I built the **deterministic calendar engine** (Mar–Jun 2025) to understand rule-based system design.  
That project later evolved into the **Bitcoin movement predictor** (Jul–Aug 2025), which became the technical bridge to my current ENA.ai recursion model.

---

## Results
- **First run:** Model self-prompted (asked and answered its own questions).  
- **Second run (Feb 25):** Fixed self-prompting behavior, achieved correct sensory classification.  
- Dataset size limited clarity, but fine-tuning pipeline worked end-to-end.  
- Demonstrated the ability to independently fine-tune and iterate quickly.

## Demo
This fine-tuned model classifies and explains **sensory modalities (VAKOG: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, Gustatory)**.

⚠️ *Note:* Outputs sometimes blend modalities due to limited data size — but the influence of fine-tuning is clearly visible compared to base model behavior.

**Example prompts**
- “What modality is *Her eyes sparkled with mischief*?” → *Visual*  
- “Why is *That’s music to my ears* auditory?” → *Auditory*  
- “Describe a storm using the Visual modality.”

## Reflection
| Date | Milestone |
|------|------------|
| **Feb 9, 2025** | Computer arrived |
| **Feb 25, 2025** | Second fine-tuned model trained (~1,200 examples) |
| **Mar–Jun 2025** | Built and completed deterministic calendar engine |
| **Jul–Aug 2025** | Extended to Bitcoin price predictor (temporal system) |
| **Oct 2025 →** | Built working recursion prototype in 19 days |

Each project built new layers of understanding — from empirical fine-tuning → deterministic logic → emotional recursion.

---

## Next Steps
- Expand dataset beyond **5,000 balanced examples** to isolate each modality.  
- Add evaluation prompts for accuracy benchmarking.  
- Apply structured methodology from deterministic systems to future fine-tuning experiments.
