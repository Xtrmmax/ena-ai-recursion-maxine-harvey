# Portfolio Executive Summary
*(Foundational Projects Leading to ENA.ai Recursion — 2025)*

---

## Overview
This portfolio documents my transition from a non-technical founder with minimal coding experience to independently building functional AI systems — from fine-tuning a large model to designing a deterministic behavioral engine.

> Before 2025, I had never fine-tuned a model or built anything in Python beyond Day 8 of “100 Days of Code.”  
> Using “vibe coding” and iterative debugging with AI assistants, I set up my local environment, trained a custom model, and later engineered a calendar system with over ten interdependent mathematical mechanisms.  
> I still don’t know all the technical terminology — but I know how to structure problems, build momentum, and make complex systems work.

## Project Timeline

### **February 2025 — Fine-Tuning Mistral-7B**
- Fine-tuned a **Mistral-7B model** on ~1,200 sensory-modality examples (VAKOG dataset).  
- Completed the full setup and training pipeline within **two weeks** of unboxing my computer.  
- Second iteration achieved meaningful refinement, proving rapid learning and execution speed.

### **March–June 2025 — Calendar Engine**
- Built a **mathematically complex calendar engine** featuring 10+ interlocking mechanisms (cyclical offsets, modular resets, leap year handling, time zones, etc.).  
- Integrated a **dataset generator** capable of scaling beyond 3,000 entries (7 MB+).  
- System modeled **behavior as a function of time**, producing deterministic symbolic outputs.

### **July–August 2025 — Behavioral Predictor**
- Extended the calendar engine into a **Bitcoin price movement predictor (manual prototype)** to test multi-variable temporal forecasting.  
- Demonstrated transferable system-design skills between symbolic and numeric modeling.

### **October 17 – November 4 2025 — ENA.ai Recursion Prototype**
- Built the full **ENA.ai Recursion** prototype from start to finish in **19 days**.  
- Translated symbolic behavioral modeling into **emotional geometry**, formalized through valence, arousal, and trust.  
- Completed architecture, deterministic engine, Streamlit cockpit, and documentation for YC review.
- Started from our behavior model and formalized it in code as vectors (direction + magnitude), not derived from the calendar work.

## Core Capabilities Demonstrated
| Skill | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Rapid Technical Learning** | Learned and applied advanced fine-tuning workflows within two weeks. |
| **Systems Thinking** | Designed and debugged layered deterministic systems from scratch. |
| **Iterative Problem Solving** | Used incremental “vibe coding” to isolate and solve logic dependencies. |
| **Cross-Domain Integration** | Took our pre-existing human behavior model and implemented it as **emotional geometry** — emotions as vectors with direction (θ) and magnitude (arousal), encoded in deterministic math. |

## Summary
These projects demonstrate that I can **design, build, and complete complex AI systems** despite a non-technical background.  
Through persistence and structured experimentation, I developed a foundation strong enough to build the **ENA.ai Recursion Engine** — a deterministic emotional system grounded in math, not luck.
