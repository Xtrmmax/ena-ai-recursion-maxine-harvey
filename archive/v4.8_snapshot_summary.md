# ENA.ai Architecture Snapshot — Version 4.8 (Public Summary)

## 1. Overview
Version 4.8 marked a key milestone in establishing structured affect processing within the ENA.ai framework.  
It introduced a two-dimensional interpretation layer designed to create measurable, consistent variation in system state responses.

## 2. System Architecture
| Layer | Purpose | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Core Layer** | Processes and aligns input signals. | Provides a stable foundation for state evaluation. |
| **Adaptive Layer** | Compares stimuli to internal references. | Supports consistent, rule-based modulation. |
| **Interface Layer** | Outputs and records system responses. | Enables transparent observation and analysis. |

**Simplified Flow**
Input → Internal Alignment → Evaluation → State Update → Output

## 3. Behavioral Framework
- Introduced structured mapping between input conditions and internal state shifts.  
- Established a neutral reference zone for balanced responses.  
- Enhanced interpretability through consistent scaling and controlled variation.

## 4. Functional Components
| Component | Function | Summary |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Core Engine** | Manages overall affect logic and routing. | Ensures stable evaluation across cycles. |
| **Evaluator** | Interprets and normalizes inputs. | Maintains consistent internal references. |
| **Interface Bridge** | Standardizes output format. | Supports visualization and recordkeeping. |

## 5. Version Summary
- **Tag:** v4.8  
- **Milestone:** Introduction of structured affect interpretation and neutral baseline reference.  
- **Dependencies:** Standard Python environment.  
- **Limitations:** Pre-container design; static calibration model.
