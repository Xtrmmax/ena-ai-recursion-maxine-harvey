# ENA.ai Version Checkpoints — v1.0 → v5.9  
*(Evolution of the Deterministic Recursion Framework)*  

---

## Purpose
This document outlines the verified milestones in the development of **ENA.ai’s recursion framework**, illustrating how the system evolved from early prototypes into a fully deterministic model of regulation and recovery.  
Each checkpoint reflects a distinct engineering phase rather than exposure of internal algorithms or proprietary mapping methods.
