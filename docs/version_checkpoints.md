# ENA.ai Version Checkpoints — v1.0 → v5.9  
*(Evolution of the Deterministic Emotional Framework)*  

---

## Purpose
This document outlines the verified milestones in the development of **ENA.ai**, showing how the system evolved from early prototypes into a stable model of deterministic emotional physics.  
Each checkpoint marks a major engineering phase in the progression from experimental loops to reproducible self-regulation.
