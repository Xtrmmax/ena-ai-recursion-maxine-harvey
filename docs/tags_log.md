# ENA.ai Tags Log Summary — Version 5.9
*(Version History & Evolution Overview)*

---

## Purpose
This document summarizes the evolution of the ENA.ai recursion framework from **v1.0 through v5.9**, completed over a focused 19-day iteration cycle.  
It records key milestones in stability, architecture, and the emergence of **deterministic emotional physics**, fixed mathematical constraints governing self-regulation, within which adaptive personas operate.

## Tag Structure & Usage

- **Semantic Tagging:**  
  Tags follow the `v[major].[minor]` convention (e.g., `v5.9`).

- **Branch Sync:**  
  - `main`: Current release-ready branch (`v5.9-final`).  
  - `migration`: Temporary branch for documentation alignment.  
  - `archive`: Preserves earlier releases (`v1.0–v5.7`) for provenance only.

- **Annotation Convention:**  
  Each tag includes a concise note summarizing its technical or architectural purpose.

## Current State — v5.9

| Branch | Tag | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **main** | `v5.9-final` | Stable, deterministic framework supporting adaptive personas. |

## Maintenance Policy

- Each feature addition increments the minor tag (e.g., `v5.10`).  
- Major architectural updates trigger a new major tag (e.g., `v6.0`).  
- Determinism and reproducibility validation are required before any new tagged release.
